## Introduction

<img src="docs/assets/go-gen%20logo.png" alt="go-gen logo" align="right" width="175px"/>

**go-gen** is a **[CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)** tool for code generation of web applications. It generates code based on the user's needs that can be passed as input in the form of a file to the command.

The objective of **go-gen** is to reduce development time of template code, while allowing **readability**, **scalability** and **testability**.

- No external dependencies.
- Motivates **[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)** by having integration tests implemented the moment the code is generated.
- Generates code so that most of the code base can seem as if it was written by one person.
- Follows good practices.
- Highly configurable.

## Technologies

The whole application was built in Go.

## Installation

To run the application in your machine you must have [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Once Go is installed you can run the command `go install` to make it available in your PATH or run `go build` and run the executable that is generated.
